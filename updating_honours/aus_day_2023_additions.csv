Under his leadership, Tasmania has consistently achieved one of the highest vaccination rates in the country and tracked on or ahead of schedule against planned rollout timelines.

Importantly, he has worked with key stakeholders to ensure high vaccination uptake has also been achieved in high priority groups including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people with a disability, along with ensuring expanded access in regional and rural Tasmania. These incredibly high vaccination rates have significantly reduced the numbers of hospitalisations and deaths experienced since borders opened in December 2021. During the pandemic, he regularly acted as the State Health Commander and the Commander of the Department of Health's Emergency Coordination Centre. In these roles, he was instrumental in other parts of the COVID-19 response including the development of Tasmania's Winter Plan 2022, which has helped guide the state through the winter flu season alongside the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Almost two years on, he continues to work tirelessly, applying learnings, adapting thinking, policy, programs and activities in line with the changing nature of the pandemic.
