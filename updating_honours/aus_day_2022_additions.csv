During the Black Saturday Bushfires of 2009, he was deployed to the eastern side of the Bunyip Forest fire as Strike Team Leader of Strike Team 9581. His Strike Team had been given the toughest of assignments, due to the impending South Westerly wind change.  During this horrific day, he led his Strike Team with distinction, particularly after it was isolated from additional support because of the rapid southern run of the fire, to the west of the Strike Team's location. He applied his extensive local knowledge to help decide which properties could be safely defended in the presence of such extreme fire conditions and deployed his crews accordingly. It was through his leadership that Strike Team 9581 was able to achieve so much against the odds during their extended 18 hour period of duty until they were able to be relieved. It was also the reason that he and his crews were all able to return home safe and well.  During his time as Captain, Mr Higgs identified the need for change, and led the transition of the Drouin West Brigade from a traditional rural fire brigade, to one capable of responding to the mix of fires and incidents typical of an active urban/rural interface Brigade. The culture of professionalism that he established remains evident today. Mr Higgs' management of the Drouin West Fire Brigade has made the communities of Jindivick and Drouin West, and Victoria a safer place. Mr Higgs has distinguished himself as one of Country Fire Authority's exceptional operational leaders and he is to be commended for over 48 years of exceptional service.  "

He demonstrated his concern for the welfare of brigade members by encouraging the use of District 12 Peers and arranging personal psychologist appointments for Marysville crews, a duty he undertook with dignity and respect. His attention to detail, his mental stamina, and his steadfast calm and compassionate leadership through these tumultuous events was exceptional.  Mr Clarke has gone out of his way to share his knowledge and experience with others through training and exercises. The quality and ability of today's CFA leaders are testimony to this training and mentoring. He enjoys the esteem and admiration of his peers and the respect of the communities that he serves.  Mr Clarke can be justly proud of his 56 years of selfless dedication to the CFA and to improving the safety of the community from fires and other emergencies.  "
